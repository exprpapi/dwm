## Patches and features

- [Clickable statusbar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/) with my build of [dwmblocks](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwmblocks).
- Reads [xresources](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/xresources/) colors/variables (i.e. works with `pywal`, etc.).
- scratchpad: Accessible with mod+shift+enter.
- New layouts: bstack, fibonacci, deck, centered master and more. All bound to keys `super+(shift+)t/y/u/i`.
- True fullscreen (`super+f`) and prevents focus shifting.
- Windows can be made sticky (`super+s`).
- [stacker](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/stacker/): Move windows up the stack manually (`super-K/J`).
- [shiftview](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/nextprev/): Cycle through tags (`super+g/;`).
- [vanitygaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/): Gaps allowed across all layouts.
- [swallow patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/): if a program run from a terminal would make it inoperable, it temporarily takes its place to save space.
